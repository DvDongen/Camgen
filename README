Camgen is a C++ template library for numerically calculating leading-order
cross sections in any QFT. For more information, look at the publication in the
doc directory or browse to

http://www.nikhef.nl/~vdoord

Camgen is licenced under the GPL (see COPYING).


1. Directories
--------------

doc     	Documentation, generated by Doxygen, and publication PDF
examples	Contains 2 example programs, treated in the pub's appendix B
include		Contains the Camgen directory with all installed headers
lib		Build area of the library
src		Contains source files of Camgen's non-templated classes
test		Contains checking programs and library.


2. Installation
---------------

Perform the usual commands:

./configure (--prefix=<install-dir> --with-LHAPDF=<LHAPDF install-dir>
--with-gnuplot=<gnuplot location>)
make
(make check)
make install
('make' in the examples directory)


3. Compiling your programs
--------------------------

If you want to use Camgen's classes and functions in a source, you will have to
tell the compiler where to find Camorra's headers and/or library. If your build
is in usr/local, the only flags you have to include are

-lCamgen

If the --prefix=<install-dir> option was used at configuration, the typical 
compilation command is

g++ foo.cpp -o foo -I/install-dir/include -L/install-dir/lib -lCamgen
